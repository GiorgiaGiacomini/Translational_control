# A workbench for the translational control of gene expression

These codes allow to quantify similarities between Ribo-seq Profiling coming from different datasets.

## Downstream phase:

- Signal digitalisation

- Comparison of the digital profiles

- A data-driven hypothesis test to assess the reproducibility of Ribo-seq profiles
